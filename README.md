## Setup and Run

To run the federated learning project, follow these steps:

1. Set up the project structure and code:
Create a folder called "federated_learning_project" and inside it, create the subfolders and files as described in the previous answer. Copy the corresponding code into each file.

2. Install required libraries:
Ensure you have TensorFlow installed. If you haven't installed it already, you can do so by running:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

3. Run the federated learning training loop:
To run the federated learning training loop, simply execute the `federated_learning.py` script:

```bash
python3 federated_learning_project/federated_learning.py
```

4. Evaluate the model:
After the training loop is complete, you can evaluate the trained federated model by running the `evaluation.py` script:

```bash
python3 federated_learning_project/evaluation.py
```

This will print the test accuracy of the model on the generated test dataset.

Keep in mind that this is a simplified example of federated learning using random data, and the model's accuracy may not be meaningful due to the random nature of the data. In a real-world scenario, you would use real data from clients to perform federated learning, and the training and evaluation processes would be more involved. Additionally, consider using a more complex model and adjusting hyperparameters to improve the model's performance.
